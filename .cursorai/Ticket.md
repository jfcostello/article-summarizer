- [ ] Set Up Testing Environment, Configuration Files, and Testing Tables #Sub-Task
  - [ ]  #tasklist
    - [X] - **Set Up Testing Tables in Supabase:** #Sub-Task
      - - Create dummy tables (e.g., `summarizer_flow_test`, `rss_feed_list_test`) mirroring production tables.
      - - Ensure schemas, indexes, and constraints are identical to production.
      Result
      - - Tables have been set up, identical to the current tables but with _testing at the end, eg summarizer_flow_test
    - [x] - **Create Separate Test Configuration Files:** #Sub-Task
      - - Develop `test_config.yaml` to isolate test settings from production.
    - [x] - **Configure Test Environment Variables:** #Sub-Task
      - - Include test API keys and Supabase URLs pointing to test instances.
    - [ ] - **Isolate Test Environment:** #Sub-Task
      - - Configure all tests to interact only with the test environment and data.
  - #### **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - - `test_config.yaml` and `.env.test` files are created with appropriate test settings.
    - - All necessary testing tables are created in Supabase, mirroring production tables.
    - - Test environment is fully isolated; running tests has no effect on production data.
    - - Documentation is provided detailing how to set up and run tests using the new configuration files.
    - - Developers can run tests locally without impacting production environments.
  - **Code Files Needed:**
    - - `config/config.yaml`
    - - `.env`
    - - `config/config_loader.py`
